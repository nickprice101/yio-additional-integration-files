# yio-additional-integration-files
Additional files that need updating to allow custom integrations to work.

This repository contains the modifications required to allow the plexmedia and netflixfiretv integrations to work. In most cases they are simply extensions of exisiting functionality.

Usage:
Copy the contents of this repo to ~/projects/yio/backups.
You can deploy these files by running the restore.sh script. This will copy the files into the correct location provided that you have downloaded the repositories using the same folder structure as described in the Yio wiki.
You shouldn't need to use the backup.sh script.
